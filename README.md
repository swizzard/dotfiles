# swizzard's dotfiles
I've been aggregating things, magpie-like, for years now. Looking it over, I honestly think the only original
stuff in any of this are the `countf`, `wcls`, and `dmerge` functions in `.bash_profile`, but I could even have
stolen/adapted those from somewhere or other. I haven't documented or noted the sources of any of this stuff,
and I feel bad about it. So, sorry everybody.
